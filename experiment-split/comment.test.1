"I’ve seen plenty of husbands who look like you hanging out at the store or the beach with their kids, so it can’t be an “appearance problem” at all, but let’s say you live in an area with a lot of preppy/“yuppie” singles or whatever: they might think your beard and physique are from some metalhead/military/“deep Southerner” background, which they’re intimidated by even *more* than they’re attracted to, and so they never even bother pursuing a connection because human beings are drawn to people’s “outside” before we ever seek a connection to their “inside” ... if all that makes any sense :P I would try this: get a handle on what type of person would attract you most physically (which might take forever, but still)."
"The freckles and the smile give your face such a soft, caring look and your nose and your eyes look so masculine."
