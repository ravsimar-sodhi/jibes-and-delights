"I have to be honest, the first thing I noticed about you was your eyes and your soft smile."
"This might sound odd, but you look like the kind of person I would love to just cuddle up to and talk."
"Though your face is good-looking in both pictures, in my opinion."
Love your eye makeup.
You gotta head on over to my friend!
Your eyebrows are awesome and I love how you‚Äôre even still smiling on a bad day!
Your eyes are like Autumn's delicate and beautiful leaves and your hair reminds me of a line from Good Vibrations by The Beach Boys: &gt; ...and the way the sunlight plays upon her hair Being discarded from a relationship is shattering.
You have a very cheery cute face and I hope for more genuine smiles for you in your future!
"Your hair is gorgeous, and you are rocking that dress girl!"
"Your face is extremely smooth, I don't buy it."
"Simultaneously, you‚Äôre not afraid to enjoy sweet things (peep the pink wall and flowers in the back)."
Your boyfriend is a dumbass who will come crawling back right after you‚Äôve moved on... you‚Äôre a classic beauty and can do better.
Tell her she needs to look in the mirror because her smile brightened MY day!üëç
"If anything, your makeup game is definetly on-point, you look gorgeous."
Very few men can grow a beard as wicked cool as yours.
Your hair alone would catch the eyes of many - it's so beautifully long and its wave patterns are the perfect balance of straight and curly.
"Stopped scrolling because your eyes looked so sad, and I‚Äôm glad I did."
Damn nice hair dude
"I seriously love your entire outfit, and your skin is flawless!"
"I love your smile, very welcoming and your eyebrows are on point!"
"Don‚Äôt let your skin get you down, you‚Äôre glowing!"
Sending love and happiness your way :)
"I've dropped out of school several times; you take your time, engage in mental-reflection, meditation, creativity, exercise -- you do you -- and then when you're feeling ready you bring out the world you've got stored in your back-pocket."
You look fantastic and your eyes are gorgeous!
"Your eyes, eyebrows, lips, nose, hair, skin - are all beautifully perfect and perfectly beautiful."
"Figure out what you want to do, a path to get there, and get going."
You look like exactly the kind of person I would want to be friends with.
Go wrap your arms around someone you love right now.
"It doesn‚Äôt matter that you fell off the wagon, as long as you dust yourself off an get back on."
"Basically, the beard was glorious - but it took away from the other good features of your face."
I also have curly hair and I always look like a poodle but damn you're killing this look.
I wish I could send some happiness your way.
And that smile looks like it lights up rooms or wherever you go.
But we have to find happiness in ourselves first.
"Your eyes are so deep, and your eyebrows are perfect."
"Just know that you‚Äôre beautiful and every time the anxiety kicks it, just mentally (or literally if nobody is around) tell that little voice in your head to ‚Äúshhhh‚Äù."
"I love this pic, there‚Äôs such a great combination of a really lovely picture of you (gorgeous eyes, hair that really suits you, getting a very ‚Äúsoulful musician‚Äù vibe from it), and then in the background there‚Äôs just a painting of Garfield, whistling a tune in a jungle."
Its physically painful to see eyes that pretty look sad!
The shirt and jacket combo is super sexy.
There's hope in your face.
Your smile made my night!
Also you are rocking that long hair
Thank you for sharing your wonderful face with all of us and I hope you have a fantastic day.
There is true light in your eyes.
You've got beautiful eyes.
When I was scrolling your picture caught my eye and I stopped and scrolled back to look at you and I initially thought it was a handsome movie star.
You are gorgeous and you have lovely hair.
"For instance, your hair is so flawless and anyone would love your appearance."
"Also if you want to actively make a change, maybe take some time to use fitness to build muscle in your butt and thighs, it‚Äôs 100% possible."
You have nice big eyes and a friendly face.
"If you ever want to have a light up circulatory system to bring out the tone of your skin, I know someone."
"Like, so cool it straight up looks like Tuxedo Mask's hair or something."
"You've got a great smile and I'd love to check out your channel, I could really use some advice on being mindful."
"This can be your ammo to shoot that negative ""voice"" right in the face."
You‚Äôre proof that a pretty face and a pretty heart can exist within the same person.
"If we‚Äôre going simply on looks, your red hair &amp; freckles are straight up catnip!"
Is that a smile that is warm and generous?
And you should definitely post that hair on .
"I'd go out with you if I could :-) Your hair is so long, I love it!"
"Your beard is superior to my own, kind sir."
You have the same color eyes as me it looks like - that kind of blue/green hazel that you want to say you have blue eyes or green eyes but they're kind of both?
You have nice facial features that are highlighted well by your makeup.
Your smile makes me want to be your friend!
You have a warm and approachable look; don't be afraid to show people your smile.
"I don't think you need to be self conscious about your short hair, you have a nice jaw line, girls would kill for that."
"I think you have gorgeous eyes, and the piercing looks really good on you!"
"Finally, your skin is ridiculously clear."
I was so excited to tell you how great your beard is but I see everyone else beat me to it!
Your wide eyes and natural smile compliment your personality perfectly.
Kind of getting boyband vibes and I like it!
"I get the feeling that you're a very kind person, and that you've been through rough patches, so you can really empathize with people's pain"
"You look like an old school pin up model, seriously you nailed the vintage look."
And you have nice hair.
"Your glasses, your smile, hair and even the dress, it all looks perfect."
"Your dad's wrong, that hair style really suits you!"
"Your smile has lifted my spirits after a rough morning, a much appreciated gesture."
Wish i had that kinda beard
It‚Äôs often hard to see your own worth or how golden you are in the eyes of others (whether they know how to properly show it or not).
That kind of insight into your own feelings and emotional state tells me that you're doing more succeeding than not.
"You have a kind face, amazing eyes, and a complexion that would make a supermodel jealous."
"Holy guac, your eyes are sooo stunning!"
Some constructive criticism... you have great thick hair.
"You should take a step back and see how you can improve or try and improve things, and eventually things will work out."
A) You‚Äôre hot af B) having been to rehab a few times myself I know how difficult going back to real life can be.
You look so fun!I love your hair and that smile is knocking it out of the ball park.
"Plus, your nose is totes aborbs!"
You have one of those faces that only gets better.
"Be aware that you have \*stunning\* eyes and awesome hair, and if you do accidentally lose one on the table you can probably fall back on being a supermodel!"
If you get down close your eyes and see me there clapping and cheering for you.
I like your nose and eyebrows.
"Don't worry about not being able to build muscle, you already look pretty strong and kindness goes a lot further than brawn and your smile shows a lot of kindness."
You have a very friendly face :)
"For the record, I sincerely love your eyebrows, and I really do think you‚Äôre pretty, in case I‚Äôve made that unclear."
You have the complexion to pull off a sweater vest- embrace that.
"Your smile is so hopeful and contagious :) Honestly, the best advice that I can give you is to follow immediately."
Your eyes pop out as well; they're stunning!
Look at that well-shaped mouth.
This picture really captured part of your personality.

before I even read anything I looked at your pic and said dang her eyebrows are on point!
"Also, you're cute and attractive (def my type, I love your hair) so you're a great person inside and out - congratulations :)"
It's your body and you have the right to decorate it!
I love your make up and hair color; they're both straight fire!
You have amazing eyes and just a nice face in general!
I think if you smiled at me irl I'd get flustered.
"Hope you have a lovely day girly, keep your head up."
"Overall you are pretty good looking, not to mention you have a very friendly smile."
Your eyebrows look really good!
Keep your head up brother and soldier on.

Love your smile üòò
Are you sure you aren't a model and had people hand select fashionable things to wear that look amazing on you?
So smooth and soft and porcelain and kind
"Often times, the more stress and anxiety that is in the picture, the more difficult it is for the body to do what it does naturally (exception being when there is a medical issue at hand with conceiving of course)."
Their lack of kindness does not define you.
I can see the weight of your struggles in your face.
"Lovely smiles, it‚Äôs so rare to see such a cute friendship!"
"You can see in your eyes that you‚Äôre a sweet, thoughtful person."
You've been thrown a pretty shitty hand and you're still strong enough to be here and that is worth celebrating.
Your ears make you super cute.
You are the kind of person who lights up a room.
"I'm sorry you're not feeling so well, you don't look entirely happy, but you're a beautiful man on the outside and you look like a kind, sweet person on the inside."

"Second, I'm jealous of your eyebrows."

Guys like you are only in the pits for a brief moment and then they are back on top.
Your face looks super soft and beautiful and you have nice hair!
There is nothing wrong with taking time out of other aspects of your life to make sure you are doing okay with the struggles you are facing right now.
Idk how you are socially inept with such a handsome face bro.
That lip color really looks nice on you.
"Hard one my ass, I mean look at those eyes dude, damn dude."
Can you give me tips on how to apply makeup??
Your hair reminds me of Gene Wilder.
Don‚Äôt let some depression kick your mental ass when you can kick its ass instead.
Your eyes are very beautiful
Seriously a lot of dudes might be envious of the healthy beard / hair combo as they can only do one or the other.

I can see a sense of relief on your face.
"There have been so many times I have felt like there was no way I could ever be happy again but sure enough I look back and think ""why did I ever think that??"""
"Your eyes are bright and lively, even in the shadows."
"Smile more, become more humorous, learn a few pickup lines lol."
"Having said that, it's normal, it happens to many people, and you *will* bounce back."
Life is never fair but keep your head up knowing you aren't part of the problem.
Tell those little voices in the back of your head telling you all these negative things that they can't have you.
You also seem to have the personality that I would hang out with.
There is something comforting in the structure of your face.
Buy some nice outfits or makeup to brighten your mood!
i know everyone has said your hair is awesome (it is) but overall you just look like a really rad guy!
I wish we had a better view of your eyes in this picture.

"You have a friendly appearance and a simple, genuine smile."
"As a person that grew up hating their face, what I've learned is that looks are so subjective..No matter how you look and how unlikely you may think it is, there are tons of people that would find our face to be their favorite."
Thank you all (and those commenting in the future) for the kind words!

But I must say I‚Äôd kill for skin as clear as yours haha:))
"The color of it really matches your lips so wonderfully and both of which are heightened by your glorious hair, and not to mention those beautiful beautiful eyes of yours, really dazzling, we all don't feel ourselves at most times, but y'know what, just keep pushing through and I know for sure that you'll be able to find your groove again, keep up the fantastic work, cheers mate üòçüòçü•∫üíûü•∞"

I am jealous of your hair and perfect short beard/stubble.
"He must‚Äôve been so desperate, did he put a bag on your face or did he just closed his eyes to avoid the horror."
You seem to have a good sense of humor - and a cute girl with a good sense of humor is going places.
Might I add that you have really kind eyes?
Your smile is adorable and shows that you have love and playfulness still in you.
You got nice eyebrows too!
Plus your glasses fit your face really well and I love your hairstyle.
The joy in your face from this post compared to the previous really makes my heart happy!
"You look like the kind of guy that can experience this kind of pain without trying to avoid it, or push it down, or lash out, or push it off on others."

Your smile lights up this picture (and probably every room) despite what you‚Äôre going through.
You're a legitimately handsome man and you have a nice smile.
I hope you're doing better right now :) I don't really know how to help you smile but I'm sending you good wishes
Scrolling through reddit feeling nobody gets it or knows me then stumbled upon a lady on toast me with a captivating smile and charming dimples and earrings make it worthwhile second guessing my own style.
You‚Äôll come back from this- maybe not with her but you will.
"But you know what, it keeps making me smile, every time I read it."
Keep smiling and keep at it.
I'll start off with saying you have a magnificent beard.

There needs to be more kind people such as yourself with both inner and outer beautyüñ§
Cause it looks bad-ass.
"Guys my age, with some exceptions obviously, typically only note makeup as a sign the woman has put EFFORT into her appearance rather than seeing it as a true beauty enhancer."

I hope I too can gain that kind of courage.
I smiled when I saw your picture because you look like you are genuinely trying to brighten other people‚Äôs days by sharing your smile with the world.

"Soon enough you‚Äôll find something that fills your soul (maybe it‚Äôll be caused by a change in scenery), and you won‚Äôt feel empty anymore."
"Did you know that is a sign of an honest, good natural soul?"
"Keep your head up, the good days will soon outnumber the bad."
Your face is so expressive - a bit timid asking us all if it is ok to want this toast.
You look like a compassionate soul and that you've got lots of love to give.
Even if you get back to being healthy physically there is always the battle of the mind you need to defeat.
":) And your skin looks so soft, love it!"
"If you need to get back on your feet it's okay to ask for help, you deserve it."

"Keep on smiling, my guy!"

Your face is super fresh

You look fucking kind my guy!
The kind of guy that would offer a coffee and a good chat to anyone you get eye contact with
