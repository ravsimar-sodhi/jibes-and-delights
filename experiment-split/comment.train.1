"I cant imagine what kind of stress you are under, but please remember that you arent a disappointment, you never will be."
Dope style and hair.
Like the kind of person everyone wants to be friends with!
"You have hope in your eyes, I feel like there is a real kindness there."
I‚Äôm jealous that you can cut your own hair so well!
You rock your piercings and I'm LIVING for that top.
No matter what you are a beautiful person and things will get back on track.
"Plus your eyes man, wow!!"
"You‚Äôre very cute, I love your dimples, you have a lovely smile."
"lucky guy who put that ring on your finger, what a catch!"
So here is your toast to being beautiful inside (Says your eyes) and out (Well obviously).
"Judging by your eyes, you seem like a very kind soul!"
"As a woman, I‚Äôm sure you can relate when I say, Do you know how *hard* it is to find a top that actually *fits* your upper body and chest?"
"I know you are on a journey to feeling comfortable in your body, just give it time."
You deserve nothing but kindness from others - other people in your life should treat you with respect and love!
You can really pull off that haircut.
"Just try to keep your head, push forward, and don't stop fighting."
"You look beautiful, absolutely love your hair!"
I really like your nail colour also!
"Don't let her back into your life, stay strong and away."
"Also, I think it's more than just coincidence that there's not enough space in the frame for both you and YOUR MASSIVE GUNS OF ARMS!"
You have wonderful teeth and a great smile!
Your smile is super adorable!
"Just gonna throw this out there, you have really pretty eyes."
And I agree - you have a lovely smile!
I like the way your hair is styled!
"Oh no, you have the sweetest face!"
Keep your fighter attitude and kick cancers ass!!
"You have kind eyes, though they seem tired too."
"You look incredible, you look like a very attractive man with stunning eyes."
You have a better beard than me and I'm 20!
"On the other hand, keep your head up."
you look great :D especially your hair
"This may sound weird, but I love your hair."
Your body looks good just the way it is!
Also I love your hair btw
You‚Äôre smile is so stunning!
"So happy you are feeling happiness, finally."
"Drink more water and get good quality sleep (you have darkness under your eyes), and be your own awesome carer and soon the universe will be knocking on your door."
"Someday, you will look back at this situation and you‚Äôll be glad that it never worked out between the two of you."
It made me smile when I saw your picture.
"You look like a sweet, thoughtful person, and maybe it's the Pikachu or maybe it is your intelligent, and expressive, eyes, but I just want to give you a hug."
Here is a picture of my fat cat in a bow tie to try to make you smile :)
"I think your beard looks great, I'm kinda jealous!"
You have one of the most beautiful facial features I've seen; and a jaw-dropping smile ;)
Maybe it‚Äôs partially the septum piercing.
Also I like your boob cleavage.
Your hair looks like a happy little cloud.
You look like the kind of guy that care about others and about what is around you.
You are a handsome man and despite how you are feeling I can see hope in your eyes and in your smile.
You have the kind of hair most women (myself included) spend years wishing for and hours trying to get!
"You have great bone structure, I wish I had your cheek bones."
Your have a killer jawline and gorgeous eyes.
"Living in pain is difficult and sometimes all you can do is focus on the simple things, left foot right foot."
"I have yet to receive any interest from a woman, none have ever found me attractive in any kind of way."
"As someone who starting go bald really young, I would have loved to have your hairline."
Wavy hair and kind eyes.
I have a compression fracture in my spin and I broke my humorous near my shoulder which also require surgery and some pins/plates.
Keep showing that gorgeous smile and I'm sure things will come your way soon :)
Your dog has nice blue eyes...wait
Your eyes are kind and intelligent.
"haha i don't know how to explain it, but you have features that are defined enough without being very aggressively in your face."
"Figure that shit out and let us know it, Let us help you be accountable to your dreams because in the end the only person that is truly responsible for your HAPPINESS is you."
Resilience is an amazing quality that not everyone shares- I can see it all over your face and shimmering off of that beautifully fierce hair.
"Anyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail."
"You went without the makeup and kept the beautiful, nice!"
Well eye like your shirt for starters :)
You seem like a very kind person and are stronger than you realize.
It sounds cliche but beauty is truly not skin deep and if you believe in yourself others will too.
I see your other comments about acne scarring and whether or not you'll be able to love yourself despite that.
"You look like all the girls I had huge crushes on in school, just such a cute face!"
But tbh your body wasn‚Äôt bad before either.
"Your eyes are very beautiful, cute face and it looks like you have a very nice figure."
You have gorgeous hair.
"I'm also horrible at guessing ages, but I would be very pleased if an age appropriate family member came in with you on their arm!"
You got dumped for being a nice person and having a big heart?
I have no doubt that the care you put into the maintenance of your beard reflects in your work and your life.
You look like the kind I'd like to hire if I was running a company.
There's a Snapchat filter to give you freckles.... Because they're adorable and so are you üòç.
I have a very strong feeling you are going to look back on that statement and laugh.
You have gorgeous eyes &amp; beautiful hair &amp; I bet you make a mean pretzel!
"In a world where everyone thinks it‚Äôs cool to be a cynic and a pessimist, being kind is the most punk thing you *can* be."
and don‚Äôt feel like you always have to put your own happiness aside for other people.
"Keep up the good work fella, and if you need a boost down the line, come on back here."
You can get on with things but be kind to yourself and get yourself ready for your escape into the wide world.
"&lt;3 I hope things get better, if you want to PM someone and talk I'm all ear."
"I also believe that if you have a kindness that I see in your eyes, you're probably pleasant to be around!"
I‚Äôd love to see you smile.
Thinning hair is not a big deal you look great and will spark somebody's eye I'm sure of it.
Honestly I'm so in love with your hair idk what you use but it's killing it in the shine department!
I‚Äôm sorry you are struggling with your body image.
You have such a sweet face and the most adorable dimples.
"May your beard grow ever longer, your stein grow ever fuller, and your glasses be even more shiny!"
I hope your leg feels better soon too!
Now would you share your acne secret?
"You have a friendly/cute face, and I really like your hair."
"Whatever struggles are pressing on your shoulders, pain in your brain, scars on your heart, it will pass."
If you want someone to talk to who shares your disorder and is just on the path of figuring this out and recovering than feel free to reach out to me!
I think your hair looks really nice!!
The world needs more nice smiles :)
"You have the type of face to pull off any hair style/color and still look beautiful!"""
"If youre willing to ask for some kind words and likes on Reddit, hopefully we can give you enough courage to ask for help from those that can give you healthy and actual help!!"
Don't let these set backs cause it to dwindle.
Put one foot in front of the other and you can't help but go places.
Amazing brightness in your eyes.
You have a beautiful smile and kind eyes!
Your skin and complexion are perfect.
"If the weights are going up, but you can't see any visible progress with your body, odds are that the changes are happening but the process is so gradual that it's hard to gauge it objectively."
I think you realize this as you're coming to a place like toastme to hear some supportive and kind words.
Love your nail polish too.
I'm digging your hair
"Try and keep your chin up, friend."
"Seconded on the pretty eyes, and you have a nice face overall."
"self-image is hard, listen to what your soul says because brains are mean, that's why you struggle."
The first thing that jumped out at me is that you have absolutely stunning eyes!
"The real glory's in your toughest, most painful moments, when you can feel in every muscle of your body just how stacked the odds are against you, and yet rise to the challenge."
Like when they tell all pretty girls that they look like meth heads who have daddy issues.
Your eyelashes are incredible.
"I really do hope you smack depression right across the face, I know it can be hard but please keep your head up"
"I love your whole look - the glasses, the hair, the tie."

"Seriously, look at yourself in the mirror with that smile and you could be confident all day long."
And you‚Äôre hair is amazing omg
Even tough you maybe have acne at 28 you still look good so no worries
"First thing I noticed wasn‚Äôt your chin but your lovely smile :) I understand the insecurity, but I promise your chin is not abnormal or obtrusive and it‚Äôs nothing to be self conscious about!"
"Wish I could pull something like that off, so much style and personality."
"You have such a kind, caring face."
"Regardless of how long the relationship is, there's always a special spot in your heart for it and it takes time and it's not anybody else business if you're sad."
"I am so overjoyed with everyone's kind and encouraging words I could cry lol if I didn't respond, I did read it and loved what you said, I just don't know what to say sometimes."
Your hair is so cool!!
"Love your hair color, I‚Äôve never been brave enough to change my color like that :)"
"I guess it's a good thing to be healthy, but the thing I notice first is your eyes, hair and teeth, you're very handsome, the weight isn't what I think of."
"It's easy to look back now and see the hypocrisy of their doctrine and practices, but being brainwashed and deluded in the cult is no joke."
You are such a jolly dude I can't help but smile.
I hope hes always on your mind and in your heart.
"You're never too old to express yourself, and your appearance is yours to play with You look great"
You have beautiful skin and hair like sleeping beauty.

"You have great hair, and great taste in plaid too!"
You are so pretty and I don‚Äôt even know you but I can say with confidence that you have one of the cutest smiles I‚Äôve ever seen.
Beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder.
You have very pretty eyes - cool glasses too!
"Damn, that‚Äôs a strong beard."
"You look amazing, I like when people go for shorter hair, also you have a great smile, 11/10"
And such a waste of your time (and perfect makeup).
It really works well with your face.
I know it doesn‚Äôt seem like it right now - but you‚Äôll look back on this and be happy as fuck she left &amp; you‚Äôll understand why things happened the way they did.
"If you want a 6 pack, work for it, but honestly tall, rippling muscles, and tan is overrated."
You have incredible skin!!
Your smile is very nice and genuine!
But you have the most beautiful face.
Your eyes tell me that you have the determination to close those negatives out so you can blossom
"Be you, be the best person you can, look for ways to put kindness into the world."

"You look strong, not the ‚ÄúI can take on the world‚Äù kinda strong, but the ‚ÄúI can keep going no matter what, even if I have to crawl‚Äù kind of strong"
"That username is gold, goes to show you have an amazing sense of humor."
The smile you have in this picture in infectious.
"Listen, times may be rough, but you look like the kind of guy that has some good karma stored up."
It's immensely draining to give your broken heart to people.
Ill bet your smile really makes those deep blues pop.
"We have the same frames, so obviously you have style ;))"
"Stop that kind of talk, friend."
"I was 21/22 before I could grow a full beard, and even now at 24 it's still not as full as I would like it to be."
"You cut a very handsome figure and have gorgeous eyes, framed by very well suited glasses."

I can tell you're a very good dog and your master loves you very much and I like his hair a lot.
"Forget every experience you've ever had, forget your skin, your muscles, skeleton, lungs, heart, brain... What is left of you?"
You don't have a face that the world is judging harshly all the time.
"Clearly, you are strong, brave, and committed to your career in the military, but I'd also guess you are sensitive, kind, gentle, and loving (and maybe don't often have the room or place to express those things)."
I don't have any idea why but you seem like the kind of guy who could pick up a bass guitar without ever having even seen one before and just play a totally sick line on it
How can you feel that way with a smile like that dude?
YOUR HAIRCUT IS AMAZING :O .
And your chin is feminine.
"Seriously, from the bottom of my heart, thank all of you guys."
"And someday that special puzzle piece is going to fit in with the right kind of people, the people that love you for who you are, and it's going to be great."
I'm seriously jealous of your ability to make your eyes pop with glasses.
That's for sharing your inspiring story and congrats on your progress and happiness!
"So with fresh eyes, I'm going to go ahead and let you know that I think you're a cutie!"
I believe you can tell a lot about a person by their smile and you have a great and friendly smile.
LOSING SOMEONE CLOSE TO US EVEN IF ITS NOT A DEATH SUCKS ASS BUT ITS HOW WE TAKE THAT LOSS AND MOVE ON.
"That right there is a glowing smile, thank you for sharing it!"
Keep your eye on the prize and take whatever steps you can to get the job you want.
"Here‚Äôs the thing, you can always go back to what you were doing before if you‚Äôre feeling super uncomfortable so it‚Äôs worth a little experiment just to see how you feel without it."
I love that your eyes look kind - and you have a good smile too!
"Tell me, who made them powerful enough to dictate what is acceptable, beautiful, and appealing to your eyes?"
Your face is very symmetrical.
Also your teeth are adorable.
I'm envious that even when overwhelmed you have a flawless complexion.
"For what it's worth, your hair looks lovely and you have awesome eyebrows."
Your glasses are hecka cute and you‚Äôve got such pretty eyes
"If you stay up long ass hours studying, that's not going to be good for you."
"they have hired you for who you are, not what you dress like."
"And I promise, if you take care of your heart, if you focus on your journey to find the things that make you happy instead of wanting other people to fill those spaces, things will get better ‚ù§Ô∏è"
You're a handsome dude and I too had my heart broke and it took a while to recover so stay positive and just realize you wouldn't want that woman back in your life when the truth shows you that she was not really worthy of your love.
I see that one eye open from your black hair you goofball.
"Pretty eyes, and good looking overall."
"You look so warm and friendly, and I have mad respect for you from the battles you've faced."
"However, your hair is fucking great!!!"
Show off that gorgeous smile and try not to give him a second thought edit: words
"GREAT hair, and it fits you."
"And on a slightly less intense note, your hair looks amazing!"
"Like, you just have a great, well-balanced face and you look like you‚Äôd be a great person to hang out with."
Your hair looks really thick and healthy too.
I love your curls!!
"You're thin but you're toned, and your nipples are sexy it's okay if they're small."
"Your hair is so nice and long and flowing, it's got perfect waves."
But keep your head up!
"you look fine but your trying to smile to much, don't force a smile but wait with camera while thinking of something you like or find funny than take the photo you end up with less crows feet in photos."
Now more than ever good people have to get good peoples backs and I just want you to know you‚Äôll always have those people here.
Those are eyes you can look into for a long time.
Not one bit creepy and I thought the same: you have lovely skin Don‚Äôt let the haters get you down.
"Not only are women not for that, being people and all, but that kind of ""validation"" is only temporary and meaningless."
Put your hand on your chest.
Hope your marriage can be a source of great happiness for you.
My inner mom monologue was instantly like DONT PUT A PLASTIC BAG ON YOUR HEAD GODDAMNIT but that pic *is* pretty lulzy.
I love how you do your makeup too.
You have beautiful eyes and a bitchin goatee.

Look at that strong brow and quirky smirk.

I am totally jealous of your complexion.
Your hair is on point and looks so beautiful.
"There are comments that advise you about your hair, look through them."
"You have lovely flowing blonde locks, beautiful rich brown eyes, and such perfectly arched brows!"
Well I think the color goes great with your skin tone.
But cry your beautiful heart out.
Made me smile too...
The only way your nose would make it into a nose job is if a surgeon used it as an example of what a nose should look like.
"Yes, sure, your eyes are like jewels and you've got a banging widow's peak."
I heard it releases some happiness hormones.
"Was it for model agency,because your smile will win the world."
"After several years, I finally realized that what I did with my body wasn't the concern of others."
"The way you carry yourself seems kind, the piercing is cool, your hair is akin to my own in colour which I find brill, and you seem to be doing well."
"The colour transition from blue to brown is easy on the eye, and isn't in obnoxiously in the face of whoever is looking."

You might have to bust your ass in a time when you feel the least inspired to do so.
"with such a smile, I'd turn quite late (like totally dead for deny'ing life of your awesome smile, ya know) then your cheeks I'd surely find fit quite well in palms of mine but when your chin, it'd surely brush, against your one and only lust, you'll stop and wonder why just then, you gave credence to internet cringe--y people saying otherwise, gross"
"Beautiful skin, big bright eyes, lovely hair."
Your hair also looks super soft and healthy!!!
It frames your face well.

Lovely red lip and love the winged liner!
Idk bro usually I don‚Äôt like the big ol frames but you pull them off super well.
"Besides, you must be a very smart guy to be studying the kinds of physics that you are."
Sun is shining from your face you beautiful human!
Personally I think a good haircut would show the bullies ( and the ladies ) what a stud you really are.
I also love your hair- it frames your face well.
"Your chin isn't discolored and you have all four limbs it appears, keep it up champ!"
"If I saw you in public I would compliment you, I am so jealous of your features and makeup skills!!"

The only way you could improve your look is with a big beautiful smile!
You have some crazy beautiful eyes!
You got a solid rack in the back there.
"Bro your beard looks awesome, I really want to have a beard like yours."
"I'm sorry about your wife, but keep working on yourself and your kids so that years from now they can look back and reminisce on how much their dad cared for them and spent time with them despite their mother's actions."
"You look like a very kind, funny and understanding person- just the kind of person who makes me feel at ease in social situations, and who makes for a great friend."
I feel like I've been seeing a lot of blue/green eyes on this sub and every time I do I get a little jealous because they are stunning!
"You have a fun look like you're the kind of guy on the ""must invite"" lost for parties and outings without being obnoxious."
"You have amazing hair, a lovely smile and deep eyes."
If you fall it's not the end of the world you can just face it and show how much better you are than that.
"You have a contagious smile, one of those doofy ones that always brightens you up when you see it."
Your eyes are stunning and your beard is awesome!
One suggestion I have is to grow out your hair a bit and style it for extra points :)
"Scrolling down my newsfeed I have been struck by your incredible, warm smile."
your hair is a lovely color and looks really soft.
And people would go to a plastic surgeon for those naturally full lips!
"3) Overall I would - honestly - rate your appearance as ""genuinely attractive."""
The color of you walls really shows how well you dress overall so you should definitely be proud of yourself.
"From the styling of his hair, to his finely pressed buttondown shirt, to what I assume is a powerful espresso machine, this man is all about the best."
Your hair curls so nicely and daintily to rest on your shoulders.
I think your nose/forehead/smile are lovely.

Sending you a virtual pat on the back/hug!
Please keep your head up and know it can get better.
"You have really such pretty and kind eyes, and your makeup is really well done!!"
It's so hard to articulate what I see in your face.
You look tired but you also look like you‚Äôre genuinely smiling.
"Also, you have kind eyes."
"22F I‚Äôll be your new boyfriend (kidding) but for real girl don‚Äôt compare yourself to others and if he‚Äôs choosing to keep his eyes off the prize then it‚Äôs time to kick him to the curb Btw you‚Äôre freaking beautiful and I love your aesthetic, but I wanted to give advice before my compliment ‚úåüèº"
"Your shirt and tattoos are awesome, your hair is rockin, and your sunglasses are perfect."
Your dark hair really makes them pop.
"Beautiful hair, pretty face :-) I‚Äôm a woman."
Love your curly hair too!
"nice lips, great eye colour, nothing to worry about tbh"
"Best of luck with everything and remember that it gets better, keep your head up and try to stay optimistic."
"I think you should do it more, I'm sure you have a cute smile."
"Love the piercing, it gives your face an awesome boldness."
"You‚Äôd look good with short hair, long hair, even an afro if wearing your hair that way was enough to make you smile."
I wish you find the happiness you seek.
Keep that smile and make it bigger because it makes you radiate.
"Also, cute face :)"
You‚Äôre a beautiful human with an even more gorgeous soul.
From one lazy eye sufferer to another I feel like yours is barely noticeable.
"Also do not feel singled out by people like that, there's genuine people like me out there that adore all reptiles i love lizards too...i love aligator eyes, chameleons, all sneks.....all of em.. all of these animals are mesmerizingly beautiful once you encounter them face to face.....unless its in the wild :p"
"You are beautiful with perfect eyebrows, chocolate brown eyes, soft shiny hair and a glowing complexion."
"This might sound like an odd compliment but you have a very nice eye shape, your eyes in general are very pretty and I love the color of them."
But like other people have said it doesn't look like you need to lose weight or anything.
And something about your eyes speaks to my soul princesa üëëüíï
May happiness be yours
you got a perfect nose there too.
You are beautiful and your smile says a lot about the lovely and funny person you seem to be !
You have really really nice eyes

Other than the fact your very beautiful I'd say I would bet you have a beautiful shy smile hiding :)
"That's some great hair man, you make me feel like I need to tidy up haha"
Your eyes rule too.
Your smile looks like they sculpted you out of the finest Italian marble.
"Judging from the shape of your legs you're not ""musculine"" at all."
Also had the beard and the haircut.
Your face makes me genuinely happy.
"I know it's difficult, but with this attitude, you'll be showing your gorgeous smile all the time :)"
I now know that bringing joy to a persons day and being kind to people is so much more worthwhile than doing things for myself.
The world is opening its eyes to that and you have a great opportunity to shine in that.
"First of all, your glasses frames really compliment the shape of your face."
"Your eyes are fuckin' striking, and there's nothing wrong with your face at all."
Your eyes are like blue diamond marbles.
"Even when the week wasn‚Äôt long enough to completely recover, it was always enough to build up enough resolve to remind me that the backlog would be worse if it built up beyond that, and I‚Äôm more than capable of catching up on a weeks worth of work (communicating with your professo is critical, most will respond and are willing to work with you even if you tell them you won‚Äôt be in touch until you see them in lecture/lab when you come back)."
"i don't see anything wrong with you ,i really like your face , nice hair and lips , very handsome man."
"Dont get caught up in your head when you dont have to, and always realize we dont have to be alone!"
"Your face is both friendly and attractive, so that mirror thing isn't true."
I feel like you have a gorgeous natural smile.
I love how your hair fades into a lighter color.
Your beard is fantastic!
I don't think the looks part is really holding you back.
Plus I loveeeeee the color of your hair.
"Hairs SUPER cool, beautiful fingers and skin and your room is a nice color."
I really love the soft curl/wave texture of your hair!!
I want to tell you that *your body is not a trigger.
"Just wanted to say that I‚Äôm blown away by your graciousness, strength and kindness."
"Also, have you had heart surgery??"
"You have a really nicely shaped head, I think you look good bald!"
No shame in being a virgin.
"Loving your freckles, eye color and that your arm shows that you and I share a past but we both put it behind us."
"You have lovely eyes, and I love your shade of lipstick."
"You're not responsible for their happiness, only yours."
I like the soft breezy way the waves surround your face.
"Your eyes, your mouth, your whole facial structure!!!"
You‚Äôre in exam season with flawlessly clear skin?
"And Jesus bleeding Christ, cat eyes sharp enough to cut diamonds."
^___^ I have a feeling it‚Äôs even more charming when you‚Äôre grinning‚Äîso I hope something happens in your life soon that brings a huge smile to your face for a long time!
You deserve happiness same as everyone else!
"I‚Äôd also bet you have a great smile, looks like you‚Äôre starting to in this picture."
I know it's cheesy but i love your hair bro!
"""You look nice today, I really like how you did your hair"" ""That shirt looks really nice on you"" ""I love that colour on you it makes you look /bright/happy/etc"" There's always something that'll stand out to you that makes you want to comment, so comment on it instead of the blanket ""you look nice today""."
I love your eyes and you have a lovely smile.
Plus wish I had that hairline
"Contrary to what some people will tell you, not everyone loves a made up face and flashy clothes."
"You look like a very fun and super nice person, your eyes are beautiful, and your eyebrows are so pretty!"
I wish u the best and your not ugly and if I knew him I would kick his ass and crush his balls.
You look like you have a kind heart and work everyday to enrich others lives.
"You are looking good, like your smile and we can share it lolüòä"
Your earrings match your necklace perfectly.
You should rock a goatee.
You are clearly very attractive with especially beautiful eyes that would certainly entice me into wanting to know you.
Regardless of your gender.
"You probably don't realize it, but you've also got more muscle in those arms than you probably give yourself credit for."
"If this is a recent picture with the weight gain showing, then you still look fantastic."
Your hair is gorgeous as well.
"Whatever choice you make, please please put your happiness first!"
Take a break to get out of your head--obsessing about it will not help.
"also I like your pretty nose ring, not to mention that really sweet smile :)"
You look fresh as fuck bro I dig the haircut.
"I wish I could just play with your hair for a while, it's lovely Edit: poem actually ain't that bad"
And did I mention the hair?
Keep your head up you are a wonderful person
I think your hair looks very cute on you.
Anyone who breaks up with somebody on Christmas probably isn't the kind of person you wanna be in a relationship with anyway.
There is a broader sense of belonging that includes you and all your flaws and sees those as character makeup to our greater society and existence.
Keeping smiling and your angelic eyes will brighten people‚Äôs days.
"You have such a clear, open, gorgeous face!"
"You have such powerful eyes, I keep getting drawn into them in both of your pictures."
Do you know how many people walk around with the same hair style for decades because they‚Äôre too afraid to step outside their comfort zone?
Your heart is in the right place for sure!
And your smile is gorgeous.
"You have very nice hands and a handsome face to match, I fully believe you‚Äôll just just fine in school."
"Also, the colours and print of your top/dress really suit you, and your eyelashes look so long here."
"Your nose looks so cute, and I love the hair."
"I've always felt weird about shaving because I feel like I look babyfaced, but you remind me that dudes without beards can look like Sterling fucking Archer."
Listen to what your heart believes you are.
"You're beautiful, it's a shame you kept that face hidden for so long."
You got good hair man!
you have a very adorable smile.
"Edited to add: I also like your username, because while Pantailamon was read as male and called ""he"", he was always the soul of a woman."
"Your hair, face and smile all look great to me, and I agree with in that I think your smile is trying to shine through there a lot."
Bet you have a great smile and laugh:) Loving the hair too!
&amp;#x200B; You've got eyes that seduce and a smile that sets the deal.
Your facial hair is perfect and your eyes are so cute.
Btw whats the gender and name?

"Man, i'm super jealous of your cheek bones!"
That fucking smile tho üòç
"Nose is perfect, love the freckles and your eyes."
"And for god's sake, you can't be defined by a number out of 10 that compares you to the rest of the human race."
I love your beard :3
"I'll try my best, how much do I ingest, My cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips."""
It's just our appearance-obsessed society/media.
You are very talented at applying makeup.
You are the type of guy that gives off really kind vibes!
"I can see that you care about people and will actually be there for them in mind, spirit, and soul!"
It seems that you've just done that and they tossed your heart back without a second thought.
You have to remember that hair is just dead stuff that grows from your scalp!
For real you still look better smiling than me haha.
Try to get some help to things back on track for yourself.
"It's easy to say when you just want any at all, but the types who would back out after learning about that aren't the types who would be worth spending the time to keep."
"They'll miss you, of course, but they will be so darn happy to see your face when you return!"
Btw you have very beautiful eyes.
I really like your eyes for some reason
"your hair looks like it's soft and moisturized well, but without being greasy."
Your smile and choice of lip stick is superb!
Full head of hair and skin that just wont quit.
maybe a slightly disproportionate mouth is your mark too.
"You need to smile more, it will bring on more approachable vi es and you will receive better inputs."
"Also, you have great hair and eyes as well!"
"Your hair is gorgeous, as is your makeup!"
"You have a sweet smile and beautiful, deep eyes!"
"Bro, with a beard as yours the only thing u need is a good smile to go with it, the men will swarm u!"
You're handsome and you have great hair!
"Have a self pamper day, do beauty stuff like paint your nails and have a facemask and then go back out there to kick ass!"
You look beautiful just wish youd smile.
"Appearance wise, you‚Äôre beautiful - I love your eyes!"
I am manic depressive and it opens my third eye.
Fantastic hair also ‚Äî you've hit the genetic lottery my dude.
Any guy would be lucky to see that cute face and stare into those eyes.
You have such kind eyes!
"The glasses bring focus to your eyes, yeah?"
"As saturated as relationships may seem, it‚Äôs not a race and the fact that no one has taken you up just means you haven‚Äôt found the right person yet!"
"Adorable nose, too, very boopable."
I love your blond hair
I want to cut my hair that short so bad but could never pull it off like you do.
You can get back on your feet and living in your car for a bit does not make you a pos.
Well groomed facial hair is like my top favorite thing to look for in the opposite gender.
You have the kind of looks that will be attractive for a lifetime.
Someone‚Äôs been downvoting you and I‚Äôm not sure why but I think you‚Äôre absolutely gorgeous ‚ù§Ô∏è Your big eyes and nice long hair is making me jealous!
It feels great and the best part is it‚Äôll grow back if you want it to ‚ò∫Ô∏è You look great.
"Bedhead or not, it's real and goes with your face/facial hair."
"Putting on weight doesn't make you ugly, or lazy, or a bad person."
You have nicely shaped lips and great eyebrows.
Please smile and love yourself!
And you have a lovely smile!
Whats wrong with your face?
"I have recently spent a few evenings in the hospital, because my father had a heart attack last weekend."
Your hair alone is worthy of time and love.
You are better off being in the right frame of mind so you can feel where the music is supposed to take you.
"I promise happiness is possible for you, and its absolutely worth working toward."
For me it was music you could really pour your heart into singing (no matter how badly in some cases).
"You just need to smile and you got everyone‚Äôs heart, wish i was there to witness it for real :3"
"I'm here if you ever want to talk, I hate that you feel alone and am always more than willing to be a shoulder to cry on, or an ear to confide in."
You look like you have a big heart!
"You seem like a chill dude, who also has a nice hair, beautiful eyes and a cool jacket, cheer up man!"
"I bet it happens when you have them on too because those are some great looking frames, the rectangular shape really creates some nice contrast with the soft features of your face, creating a nice balance."
Also (and please take this in a not creepy way) you are stunningly beautiful with your smile and face and hair.
You will be back on your feet quite quickly.
Your noise piercing also suits you nicely.
You have a natural calling to helping people and it could be really helpful to talk to one about all kinds of things.
Your hair drapes you perfectly.
I think you spend too much time comparing yourself against the false appearances of others.
"Since a was kid, I never wanted to be blonde or redhair but your hair color is so unique as the person who carries it."
all in your head.
You have a really amazing smile and I love your hair!
And your hairstyle really fits you.
The best advice I can give is to keep your head up high and work hard.
First image: I love how your hair frames your gorgeous face.
"You have a handsome face, and I bet you'd look great with a cowboy hat even if you wore it just for fun, and if that worked, you could add a flannel shirt."
Wash with it morning and night and maybe even when you get home from school and you'll see an awesome difference in your skin.
Keep that beautiful smile on your face and conquer the world one day at a time &lt;3
And I‚Äôm sure your skin thanks you :)
Your hair and eyes are adorable!
"You should have zero trouble charming the interviewer with kind, confident eyes like yours."
"You‚Äôve got a great energy and you seem like a fun guy to be around, keep ya head up!"
"Beauty is not skin deep, and you opening up and asking for some reaffirmation is entirely healthy and a sign of a bright person."

All the best for the future ü§ì"

"Worry not, though, I can still get my work done at a usual pace‚Äì‚Äì in fact, it helps keeping me distracted although being in a public space would be rather overwhelming right now which I feel pretty fair enough the fact that Faustina isn't in and I have no shoot today, and an isolated place right now enables me to be more productive and get more work done‚Äì‚Äì so being in a WFH situation for the moment would outweigh in terms of productivity (I can get a lot more work done as per this situation) as for my current situation as much as I want to come in for work and immerse myself in a totally different environment and joke around with everyone else as usual... but unfortunately, putting up such ""cheerful"" mask is rather emotionally taxing more that I'd like it to be at the moment; on the other hand, if I come in looking not-as-cheerful as my usual being, I'm afraid that people are going to start to suspect that I'm not in my peak mental state."

"You're so cute, and you have warm, kind eyes!"
"They received a ""good morning"" or a ""I love your hair"" or even a ""that is awesome."
You have such a pleasant face...serene and peaceful and sweet.
"You're gorgeous and if you can get yourself to smile with all of your face rather than just your mouth, you'll see and feel a noticeable difference."
"Your eyes and smile are lit with happiness, and it‚Äôs beautiful to see!"
I have no idea what this sub is but I like your eye brows.
You have really trustworthy eyes.
"Like, kinda quirky, but something that brings a soft smile to other‚Äôs faces."
That face reflects a warm heart.
I LOVE your chest tattoo of the crystals.
Such a sweet smile!
Also your eyes are a beautiful shade of brown that goes wonderfully with your hair!
"Your eyes are beautiful, even with the sadness in them."
It suits your features wonderfully; you look almost elvish with your elegant expression and hair.
"""Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one remembers to turn on the light""."
I look at my scar riddled body and often think not today fucking cancer.
Look at that jawline!
I love how thick your hair is!!
"Keep showing your kindness to others, and you will see it reflected back to you tenfold!"
"You have a super friendly face, take advantage of that."
"Cat poop, another dog‚Äôs mark, a rotting chicken bone (exultation), and you."
Your eyes are popping.
"Hopefully you‚Äôre in for some real smiles on your face, because even the fake one looks nice."
Lady you are gorgeous and your figure is perfection!
"And wow, your eyes are like a sea of chocolate."
"Second, you are going to kick this health thing in the ass then kick even more ass getting things handled."
"You're better at balancing an alcoholic beverage on your head than me, I've been watching for a minute now and it still has not fallen."
Your face is open and approachable.
"Idk if it‚Äôs the angle of the pic or not but you look really good in that shirt, I see some muscle on that arm so I‚Äôm gonna take my chances and say that you just look hella good in that shirt."
I hope that you can find your in your soul to be at ease today.
"I wasn't going to write anything at first, because I'm likely old enough to be your mom, but you have great eyes and need to know it."
They'll help keep you strong while you figure things out.
I have every faith that you're going to do just fine:) and dating is gonna be a cinch with them pretty eyes
"you matched your lipstick and eyes with your necklace nice job, how old are you anyway?"
"Looks sick man, but is it just the lighting that is making your arm look blue?"
You have beautiful skin!
Your eyes are so sad that is made me stop and read every comment in here hoping that someone had found the right words to change the sadness in them.
"While you're at it just might as well hand your eyes over too.. Fuck it might as well just give me your head, make it easier on the both of us."
You have friendly eyes and a great smile.
"Plus, that mirrored candle holder is totally not haunted or the gateway to a hell dimension and if it is, you look like just the guy to kick Satan‚Äôs ass."
You have a kindness about you that just screams in this pic!
I really like your face.
"You are stunning, and I can sense you have a wonderful smile."
"If it's just your natural lip shade, dang, good for you!"
"You have such pretty eyes and a warm smile, someone out there will not be able to get enough of them and will treasure you!"
"Life is shitty right now, but you clearly have a huge heart, and I think things will get easier because of that."
"Your eyebrows also are amazing, though that's not a compliment guys really comprehend, it's definitely working for you!"
SLAY ME NICE TEETH??
It's in your smile.
It'll be a huge relief when you're done and get to go home and curl up on the couch with a movie:) just don't overdo your studying or it'll stress you out more
Your bone structure is angelic
I think your forehead hair is wonderfully cute!
"Seriously though, I am jealous of that hair."
i love ur hair color!!!!!
Well that‚Äôs a beautiful face if ever I‚Äôve seen one.
"I have never been able to figure out how to wear a slouchy beanie correctly, and you‚Äôre really rocking it."
You have beauty blue eyes and I love your freckles.
"You have such a good beard, which is a major accomplishment."
I was actually having a discussion with a friend about eye colour preference (that sounds weird seeing it typed out).
"Your smile is infectious and I hope you have a great time, win or lose."
It'll be hard and there will be bad days but you are capable of anything and I'm here to talk if you ever need an ear.
"You look like a really nice person, kind face."
your eyes are just wow.damn.
I like your half smile :) Also you suit black.
Do you know how much easier my life would be in the morning if my eyebrows were symmetrical?
I think I cut myself on your eyeliner.
"Don't forget to make her laugh, and show off your awesome smile!"
You keep being a good person who has a good head on their shoulders and you're bound to get by.
"You are not alone, your heart will heal, hope is part of who you are, and direction doesn't matter as long as you move forward."
You have the kindest brown eyes and give off teddy bear vibes.
"Okay on the contrary , have you ever thought that you can make other people's rough day a very smooth one with your pretty smile ?"
The way you wear that eyeliner really suits you and gives you an awesome vintage look that not everyone can pull off well.
"Other than that, your skin is fantastic, your hair is great, you're very handsome and have an extremely kind smile."
"You are beautiful, oh my goodness if only you could see you through our eyes."
"You have a really pretty smile, and I love the color in your eyes, You look stylish c:"
"You are beautiful, love your eyes!"
"You should hope for a better tomorrow for *you*, not that this one specific person will come back."
"As a fellow BPD and PTSD sufferers who gained a lot of weight due to binge eating, I‚Äôm so proud of you for your courage to gain control of your life!"
Your beard and natural ability to make a beanie and hoodie look good has me jealous.
"I hope my compliment helps you in the long run as my friends helped me: you are good looking, and have beautiful eyes."
I envy your hair poof.
The problem with /amiugly is that their remarks say more about the commenters than about any of the posters; I feel bad for them because they hinge their whole self-esteem on their face ratio or some hokum that they think makes them a 6.5/10 then project that onto everyone else.
"Keep smiling, you badass mofo."
You have Disney cheeks.
"I wish that you could see your jaw, chin, flawless skin, and fluttery eye lashes, like we do."
I like how a little bit of your personality is showing through your smile too.
Also your skin is super clear and a great complexion!
"Sir you've got the hair that reminds me of a heavy metal God, careening through sunrise sky on a Pegasus shredding gnarly riffs of glory for all the world to gaze upon in awe."
"You are the definition of a cutie,beautiful eyes aswell."
"Happy cake day, you have a nice beard, nice eyes and great Ghost Busters collection."
"Your hair looks really nice, my dude!"
Good on ya for taking care of yourself and figuring out what works best for you.
"You seem to really like the beard, so hopefully you can grow it back, but I wouldn't stress at all in the meantime."
"Btw, I love your hair and your piercing!"
You kind of look like the Hemsworth brothers‚ù§Ô∏è
"Dude, you got a dope beard, I'm jealous!"
You are stunning and I love your eyes.
I hope you find peace and happiness in the near future!
"and when you can't, take a shower, clean your teeth, and let the hard times flow past you."
"I don't know if it was meant that way, but it made me smile."
All you need is a smile on your face.
"But if you still don‚Äôt believe me, keep in mind that you‚Äôre still young and our bodies keep developing until the mid twenties."
Hopefully this comment keeps you smiling because it suits you!
You got a solid jaw and a pretty slick hair style.
i like your style and i love your nose piercings!
Your hair looks very cool.
You have such expressive eyes and you look so pretty.
"I feel like I'm the kind of person I'd have looked up to as a kid, but I hate myself as an adult."
Where did you get the jacket?
"Just shows what a kind soul you are, dedicating your life to helping others!"
"I don't really see anything wrong with your face skin care wise or anything else for that matter, you are a very beautiful young woman and it's only going to get better for you as time goes on"
"Actively embracing the freedom and knowledge that she herself was in no way to blame for some tosser's flawed.... No, ABSENT personality?"
"You would reach out your hand and a naked woman, ten feet tall on a horse made of lightning would sweep beside you and place an electric guitar made of pure energy into your hand."
When i was 25 my dad died suddenly from a heart attack.
"Also, you can grow a beard making you cooler than my genetically inferior face ^^/s ^^sorta"

It's real joy in the face of difficult times.
"They'll always have a special place in your heart, but as time goes on you'll feel better."
:( Really glad you are able to smile here though.
I adore your smile!
"That may take until college (as it did for me), but it'll happen, and it's best to not give a fuck about those assholes rn, and just focus on what you're interested in."
Can always go back for whatever degree you want.
"Interacting with people can be tough, but it can be easier when you don't have to do it face to face."
I perceive you to be a very sweet and gentle soul.
"And your eyes, gosh, can't stop looking."
But I've learned that there is not much point in putting your head in all the negative thoughts.
Your hair is unbelievably lush.
"The you that reads this now will be a completely different person to the you that brushes your teeth tomorrow, and an even more different person to the one who brushed them ysterday."
"Maybe like a cross between light coffee and a whopper, I bet if I bit you you'd be sweet like your personality."
That is always something you can look back and be proud about.

"Your makeup looks amazing :) I know times are tough, but hang in there."

"An example of trying to do that for a piece like this would be to maybe have the legs less tucked away, the left elbow bent out more so it doesn't hide behind the sword, and lastly make there be some space in between the cotton candy hair and the armor so that it doesn't merge with the rest of the body."
Your hair is awesome and I love the way you carry yourself in this picture.
"Though I am disinclined to believe out of hand that you have no friends, I'm not qualified to make assertions about the truth of your perception of your social and emotional circumstances."
"The winter may be cool, but so is your hair, style, and username!"

"Your eyes are so kind, when I look at you I feel comforted ‚Äî y'know?"
"That beard is incredible and must've taken a long time to grow it out -- looks so healthy, but not only that, I think your eyes are a beautiful shade of grey, maybe dark blue?"

"You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.‚Äù ‚Äï Roald Dahl &amp;#x200B; And I believe in this with all my heart."
The best revenge is to move forward and find happiness.

It shows off your beautiful smile and the length of your arms and your pretty outfit so it is a good photo.
"One day, you'll be able to look back with pride and be happy that you fought those battles because your life matters so much more than you can sometimes lead yourself to believe."

"Please smile, I‚Äôm sure you have a wonderful one!"
"Enjoy yourself and relax because if for some crazy reason your personality doesn't mesh well with the interviewer, you probably would have hated working there anyway."
And the hair and facial hair are both on point.

I'm so jealous of the color of your hair I've been trying for over a year with various stylists and no one can get that white color.
Holy crud your hair is absolutely fabulous - and talk about a clean face.
You could experiment with different hair styles at every stage of length!

I have no doubt that you will smile again.
"But good people get back up, strengthen themselves and fight on like you‚Äôre doing."
"And I love your beard :) keep your heard up, because everything gets better in the end if you keep a positive attitude!"
And then I remembered you were concerned about your nose.
"Also, I couldn't figure out how to get my phone camera to stop flipping pictures horizontally, so instead of manually re-flipping the picture I took the time to write the sign out backwards and that felt like an achievement"
Your hair and face looks amazing!

You've got a decent smile for someone who's sad all (or most of the) time (so you've got that going for you).
You look like the kind of guy I‚Äôd walk into and immediately decide I‚Äôm going to be best friends with.

Making the decision to loose weight and following through with it is one of the hardest challenges in life.
Those hands are big!
The way your hair spirals down is really captivating for some reason.
Your ex has messaged you to put you down because people who know that others who are to kind and good for them will never allow others the space to recognise that.

You don't have to look like something to have gender dysphoria.
Be kind to yourself ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä
If I were an artist I would die to draw your hands!

Normally I don't really care for dark frames like that but you make them look amazing.
"You're very pretty, and your face is beaming with your smile."
"Hold on in there, things will get better :) Advise I tell my stepson and cheesy I know, but look in the mirror each morning and either smile or tell yourself you‚Äôre awesome... starting the day on a positive helps manage the crappiness."
But I can tell by you admitting you're having a hard time by posting this message that you're strong enough to get back in that ringer and show this woman that you're gonna kill it the next time you meet.
I'll brush your hair if she won't!!
"No matter how much you feel as life is over, whenever that thought comes up, give your kids a tight hug, look them in the eyes and say that you love them, and you'll remember why it is worth living and fighting: To make your kids proud and make them happy again, by becoming happy yourself after such a major hit!"

I love your hair as well.
I'm sure it feels nice to not have any strands tickle your face!!
"If something interests you, I would assume you are like me and would dive into it head-long for hours at a time while having fun."
"Dude, dead serious, when I saw your face I automatically thought ""Director""."
"I‚Äôd date you, assuming you have a decent personality."
"But most of all, you have such a kind heart."
"You have turned that on its head, both with the words themselves but more importantly you have managed to convey an incredibly complex situation in a very simple way."
Those eyes are simply mesmerizing.
"someone whose smile unleashes the brightest day, a rebel queen in the best damn way; Everywhere she goes she leaves her mark, even on toast with ink that is dark; A rainbow sheikh, she dazzles, her subjects enthralled, with breathtaking hair--the inverse of Molly Ringwald; Eyes mysterious and light years deep, One things's clear: she get's her beauty sleep; How to match her style, I don't have the slighest clue, She fucking rules, that someone-who"
"9/10 you would be amazing in some fantasy stuff, elf like, good bone structure, I'm in loveeeee"
I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you; no one deserves that kind of treatment.
"I can't find any features at fault, seriously the structure of your face with high cheekbones looks on point, the eyebrows frame your face really nice, your eyes look lovely, you have a cute nose and I think your chin looks fine."
Your face is really pretty and I think your lips suit you!
"Take more pictures of yourself and don‚Äôt feel pressured to wear makeup, you don‚Äôt need it."
I love the colour of your eyes .
"I have such pathetic beard growth, I'd do anything to have your beard."

Keep your chin up and keep moving forward!
"God says the eyes are the gateway to the spirit/heart, and you seem to be a great friend based on what I can see!"
Your car may be broken but you look like a professional race driver.
You see the way the right side of your mouth curls up just a teeny tiny bit?
"I‚Äôm single now but I‚Äôve held hands with lots of pretty girls in the in-between ;) I‚Äôve found that I never get into a relationship when I‚Äôm actively trying to do so, it‚Äôs only when I give up &amp; focus on doing stuff for myself that people start seeing me as the awesome girlfriend I could be... Something about confidence &amp; having your own friends &amp; hobbies, probably."
you have one freakin cute nose
"I like your face, the shape of your nose is very nice."
"Kind eyes, nice hair and a bit of a weird smile."
"If you never got a compliment it's not because of your looks - I'd like to point out your strong chin - but because the people around you generally don't compliment others, maybe?"

"I‚Äôm sorry about your heartbreak :( I hope you feel better soon, you‚Äôre very handsome with a gorgeous smile üíï"
Your sadness is a sign of your good heart and while it‚Äôs unpleasant to feel so down - it‚Äôs also a valuable trait to be able to feel such compassion and care for others.
"It really adds an air of refinement to your face, I think, especially because it works so well with the rest of your features!"
Not a body living to be a certain size or look a certain way.

You look like you have a really good sense of humor to me.
"For now, best to just focus on you for a while (your studies or your work) and when you‚Äôre ready, jump back on the horse and chase what you deserve."
Then maybe you won't have to force that smile so much.
"Just gotta keep that chin up, and keep the rig rolling, or just watch a shit load of letterkenny and quote it daily until someone finds it amusing enough that they ask you out, that's how I met my new girlfriend...only worked maybe 10% of the time"
"Nobody would ever see anything but your eyes, they're really beautiful"

Your eyes are truly exquisite and your smile is simply lovely.
Your eyes look friendly and I would love to give you the biggest hug ever!
I decided to comment on yours because of a post you made in creepydms or something like that - A guy was being inappropriate and you reminded him that you are more than your body.
your eyes and cheeks scream disney princess.
"Just take things one day at a time, take however long you may need to heal, and get yourself back out there!"
"But to answer your question, the only comment I could make about this picture: Your bangs are resting in between your eyebrows in a way that might give some the impression of a unibrow, which might make some people feel weird about this specific picture."
you have perfect eyebrows
You just need a haircut and some new clothes.
"I know how far depression can take you down, I've had times its dragged me so deep into the darkness of my mind I never saw a way back, but I promise you that you can drag yourself out of it no matter how deep it drags you."
You are obviously a creative soul and I can see you are artistic as well.
"You look suitably serious for someone in a position of responsibility, keep in mind that you are now in a role that means that you are accountable.... it is easy to say to someone to smile more, no-one likes to ask why someone isn't smiling as much... probably because they don't want to hear the answer :) You look smart, intelligent and focused, keep your chin up, you are going to do a great job."

Being active immensely helps anxiety and takes your mind off the fear and onto the task at hand.
Love your hair and smile a lot.
It's amazing what a little trimming can do to a physical appearance and also it can make you feel awesome!
Your hair is such a pretty color and your smile is super bright!
Also might sound weird but you have a beautifully shaped head
You ever met a cat that would jump up on the shoulder of some schmuck and wait for glory.
Shaved head looks great pal.
I hope you find others that help you to find the love for yourself... for that kindness (paired with an awsome NASA jumper!)
"And once you find that person that loves the crisp your slightly overbaked cheese gives off, you will find happiness.. oh who am i talking to, you don't need to find someone else for that, we both know that you wear that happniess deep withing those trustful brown eyes of yours!"

"May your adventures keep feeding your soul, your humor keep brightening the room, and your work keep making the world a better place!"

"You might get this a lot from women, but I am SO jealous of your eyelashes!"

I know how hard it is personally to disengage yourself from these kinds of people.
I assume you don‚Äôt want to be seen because you‚Äôre worried of the amount of people who will instantly fall in love with your handsome face the moment they see you?
"Not allowed to give advice in this thread so I PM'd you, but your hair is absolutely stunning."
Even with a doggy snoot and floppy ears your still cute and you really should blame the loser ex for your strep.
"Also, you have nice hair."
I'm sorry for everything you're going through and your boss sounds like a real asshole.
Your eyes are an amazing color and your smile is adorable.
I love your hair and those eyes are model like.
"Your body art is unf, so cool."
"I don't know if you've tried it, but you can get gel ear plugs that mould to the shape of your ear canal, these can be comfortable to wear while sleeping and block out a lot of noise, if hearing your alarm is a concern, invest in an activity band that has a vibration alarm and wear it to bed."
I hope you get through all the challenges you are facing.
"I really don't think there's anything wrong with your body, you look great!"
"Most people are better than that, and I'm glad you're seeking those people out rather than taking the negativity to heart."

Happy Pride I‚Äôm amab but just came out as gender fluid.
"Instead, you are the kind of guy who shows up courtside (never mind the cost because you're not going to tell your bangin' date how much they actually were) and politely tells Jay-Z how much you appreciated both the Blueprint 1 and 2."
"It‚Äôs a beautiful hat, the colour is quite nice and the stitching is amazing, great job :D May it keep your head warm for a long time."
"You have a very natural elegance to you; you look the same waking up as you do when you're at a social function, and that sweatshirt and undone hair morning, the unpainted and untarnished presentation of self is what so many people desperately lack, and so they have to cover and smear their face with paints."
And I hadn't noticed how long your hair actually was in your previous posts.
"You have stunning eyes, and your dimples are absolutely adorable."
The blue fade in your hair is really cool!
You have a friendly smile.
You also coordinate with your action figures well.
"When you cross the finish line, though, you look back at times where your legs were hurting, or you were having second thoughts about being able to make it, or when the whole thing seemed like a really stupid idea, and you know that you were strong enough to make it."
I've seen it with my own eyes.
"I wish there was something I could do which would help you to feel better, but today I'll wrap my arms and you and hold you while your blood dries up."
Very cute with a pretty smile.
I overdosed on a bunch of pills and slit my wrists.
"Giving love, spreading kindness...it‚Äôs the best way to bring it back to yourself, I promise."
"However, I don't post often unless I have a genuine compliment because I don't like hollowed out ""ur eyes r pretty"" just for the sake of saying something."
"Perfectly symmetrical faces are less interesting ;) Take care of yourself, and please don't be with someone who doesn't appreciate you"
"You have one of the kindest faces I‚Äôve ever seen, which feels weird to say because it‚Äôs not usually something that jumps out at me."
"Hello, you seem like a really heartfelt and kind person."
The next leg of adventure in your life could be right around the corner.
Fight tooth and nail to keep this upwards momentum going.

"Congratulations on the weight milestone, you rock, I am seriously impressed."
I love your hair and you've got such a regal face :)
I'm guilty of scrolling by sometimes instead of checking out posts properly but I had to stop and say you put a huge stupid smile on my face.
Don't let your depression hold you back.
I wish I could grow a beard like that or have some resemblance of a jawline.
"Yes lad, those curls!"
"And I think sometimes, even If all is good, we all need some toasting, a few kind words, a smile from a stranger or just a simple hello :) And If you are the one to give that simple hello, or smile towards a complete stranger, (not in an awkward way haha) or say something nice to someone, people will pick up on your positivity, and most of the time they will probably be kind back :) also, spend more time doing something you love/like doing."
You have a cute smile
Lol what the fuck kind of terrible boyfriend is that?
I really like the color (and this is a slightly odd thing) and the shape of your eyes.

"The last few months may not have been kind to you, but you'll make it."

"Dude, don't worry about your appearance."
"He looks like a really nice guy, he has a warm smile and suppose he has a great personality."
You‚Äôve got the bone structure of a Greek god You look like Orlando bloom
